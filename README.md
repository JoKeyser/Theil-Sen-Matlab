# Theil-Sen estimator for Matlab

[![View Theil-Sen Robust Linear Regression on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/132443-theil-sen-robust-linear-regression)

## Description

A stand-alone Theil-Sen estimator for robust simple regression in Matlab.

("Stand-alone" means that no toolbox is required.)

### Theil-Sen estimator

A [Theil-Sen estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator) provides robust linear regression for one predictor:
The resulting estimates of slope and intercept are relatively insensitive to outliers.

The implementation in [TheilSen.m](TheilSen.m) is exact but naïve:
It generates the set of all pairs of the _n_ input samples, resulting in an overall complexity of _O(n²)_ in speed and space.
The resulting slope and offset are the median slope and offset of the lines defined by all data point pairs.  
(Note that alternative implementations of the algorithm have lower complexity, and are thus much faster for large amounts of input samples.)

### No toolbox required

This code is based on [Theil-Sen Robust Linear Regression](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48294-theil-sen-robust-linear-regression), version 1.2.0.0, by Zachary Danziger (which in turn is based on [Theil–Sen estimator](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34308-theil-sen-estimator), version 1.0.0.0 by Arnout Tilgenkamp).
Note that these previous versions depend on the (commercially licensed) [Statistics Toolbox](https://mathworks.com/products/statistics.html).

This version uses `median(X, 'omitnan')` instead of `nanmedian(X)` to avoid dependency on the Statistics Toolbox.

See the [changelog](#changelog) below for further modifications.

## Installation

Copy the files to your computer, and add the folder to Matlab's path variable.

## Usage

Please refer to the comments in the header lines of [TheilSen.m](TheilSen.m).

### Example

The script [example.m](example.m) simulates data based on known, "true" values with minor, additive Gaussian noise.
The data are then corrupted with a small percentage of outliers.

The data are fit with the Theil-Sen estimator and least squares, for comparison.
Note how a few "unlucky" outliers can bias the least squares estimate (LS), but have little effect on the Theil-Sen estimator (TS).
