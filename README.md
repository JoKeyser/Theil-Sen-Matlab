# Theil-Sen estimator for Matlab

## Description

A stand-alone Theil-Sen estimator for robust simple regression in Matlab.

(Stand-alone: No toolbox required.)

### Theil-Sen estimator

A [Theil-Sen estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator) provides robust, simple linear regression in the 2D plane:
The resulting estimates of slope and intercept are relatively insensitive to outliers.

The implementation of [TheilSen.m](TheilSen.m) is exact but "naive":
It generates the set of all pairs of the _n_ input samples, resulting in an overall complexity of _O(nÂ²)_ in both speed and space.
The resulting slope and offset are the median slope and offset of the lines defined by all data point pairs.

(Note that other implementations of the algorithm achieve better complexity, and are thus much faster for large amounts of data points.)

### No toolbox required

This code is based on [Theil-Sen Robust Linear Regression](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48294-theil-sen-robust-linear-regression), version 1.2.0.0, by [Zachary Danziger](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1044524).
A key modification is to use `median(X, 'omitnan')` instead of `nanmedian(X)` to avoid dependency on the (commercially licensed) [Statistics Toolbox](https://mathworks.com/products/statistics.html).
See the [changelog](#changelog) below for further modifications.

(Note that there are several other implementations of the Theil-Sen estimator on Mathworks's [File Exchange](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange).
Unfortunately all were found to depend on the Statistics Toolbox, [except one](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43135-regression-utilities), which was judged to be slower and less versatile.)

## Installation

Copy the files to your computer, and add the folder to Matlab's path variable.

## Usage

Please refer to the comments in the header lines of [TheilSen.m](TheilSen.m).

### Example

The script [example.m](example.m) simulates data based on known, true values.
It then fits and compares the Least-Squares with the Theil-Sen estimator.
Note how a few "unlucky" outliers can bias the least-squares estimate, but have little effect on the Theil-Sen estimator.
